In this new setup, we add firewalls to protect each server, they filter network traffic in and out ofw a machine.
We also add a SSL certificate tu secure the traffic, this is now HTTPS, wich means if someone intercepts the traffic, it cannot be read.
The SSL terminates at the web server, because if it stopped at the load balancer level the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers would be unencrypted.
We also add 3 clients to monitor to check if something is broken or slow by collecting data and sending it to the monitoring system.
We can also have an alert triggered if QPS is getting out of control.
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue because if the master goes down, the application cannot write to the database anymore
Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem because their consumption will not grow the same way between each of them (we might want to have more database servers than application servers for instance).
The load-balancer is still a SPOF.
