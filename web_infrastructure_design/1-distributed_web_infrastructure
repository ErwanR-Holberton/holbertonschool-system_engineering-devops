With this new structure we added servers for redondancy and a load balancer to distribute traffic on the servers.
The balancer can be in Active active mode meaning that both servers are running or active passive meaning that the other are waiting for the first to fail.
The data is replicated in each database to keep synchronisation, so there is a master database that accept writes and reads while the other(s) only read.
The load balancer is still a single point of failure.
We are not managing security on this server, maybe our database does not contains top secret documents so no firewall, no cryptage, no monitoring.
